# Infrastructure Layer CAP Enhancements

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Infrastructure Layer enhancements implemented to resolve critical CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) issues identified in the Identity module.

## Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. Dependency Inversion Violations (CRITICAL)

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive circuit breaker pattern with monitoring.
**Impact**: Prevents cascading failures and improves system availability.

### 4. Infrastructure Test Coverage (HIGH)
**Problem**: <30% test coverage for infrastructure components.
**Solution**: Created comprehensive testing framework with mocking and integration tests.
**Impact**: Improved code quality and reliability.

### 5. Missing Health Check Dashboard (HIGH)
**Problem**: No comprehensive infrastructure monitoring.
**Solution**: Implemented health check dashboard with real-time monitoring.
**Impact**: Better visibility into system health and faster issue resolution.

### 6. Distributed Transaction Support (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: No support for distributed transactions across services.
**Solution**: Implemented Saga pattern for distributed transaction management.
**Impact**: Ensures data consistency across microservices.

### 7. Event Ordering Issues (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: No event ordering guarantees in distributed environment.
**Solution**: Implemented event ordering with partitioned processing.
**Impact**: Ensures correct event processing order across consumers.

### 8. Cache Consistency Issues (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Redis cache adapter lacked consistency guarantees.
