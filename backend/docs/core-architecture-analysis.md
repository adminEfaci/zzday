# Core Architecture Analysis

## Event System

### Event Bus Implementations and Their Use Cases

The codebase implements two event bus variants:

1. **InMemoryEventBus**: 
   - Single-process event handling
   - Synchronous and asynchronous handler support
   - Handler inheritance support (base class handlers)
   - Ideal for development, testing, and single-instance deployments

2. **DistributedEventBus** (Redis-based):
   - Multi-process event distribution via Redis Pub/Sub
   - JSON serialization for cross-process communication
   - Event registry for dynamic event class lookup
   - Suitable for horizontally scaled deployments

### Event Registration Mechanisms

```python
# Simple registry pattern
_EVENT_REGISTRY: Dict[str, Type[DomainEvent]] = {}

def register_event(event_cls: Type[DomainEvent]):
    _EVENT_REGISTRY[event_cls.__name__] = event_cls
```

- Events are registered by class name
- Registry enables dynamic deserialization in distributed scenarios
- Type-safe event class retrieval

### Event Flow and Processing Patterns

1. **Event Metadata**:
   - Unique event IDs for deduplication
   - Correlation IDs for request tracing
   - Causation IDs for event chain tracking
   - Timestamps and versioning
   - Aggregate metadata (ID, type)

2. **Handler Types**:
   - **EventHandler**: Base async/sync handler with error logging
   - **BatchEventHandler**: Accumulates events for batch processing
   - **CompensatingEventHandler**: Includes compensation logic for failures

3. **Event Tracking**:
   - Context variables for correlation/causation propagation
   - EventFlowTracker for debugging and visualization
   - Structured logging of event flows

### Distributed vs In-Memory Event Handling

| Aspect | In-Memory | Distributed (Redis) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Performance | High (no serialization) | Lower (network + serialization) |
| Scalability | Single process | Horizontal scaling |
| Reliability | Process-bound | Survives process crashes |
| Complexity | Simple | Requires Redis infrastructure |
| Use Case | Dev/Test, Single instances | Production, Multi-instance |

## CQRS Pattern Implementation

### Command/Query Separation

- **Command**: Immutable objects representing state changes
- **Query**: Immutable objects representing data requests
- Clear separation enforced through base classes with `frozen=True`

### Handler Registration and Discovery

```python
# Command Bus
self._handlers: Dict[Type[Command], CommandHandler] = {}

# Registration prevents duplicates
if command_type in self._handlers:
    raise ConfigurationError(f"Handler already registered")
```

- Type-safe handler registration
- Single handler per command/query type
- Runtime validation of handler presence

### Validation and Authorization Integration

- Commands/Queries use Pydantic for validation
- Authorization can be implemented in handlers
- Structured error handling with logging
- Command execution includes success/failure tracking

### Performance Considerations

- Lightweight command/query objects
- Direct handler dispatch (O(1) lookup)
- Async execution support
- No unnecessary abstractions

## Repository and Data Access

### Repository Base Classes and Interfaces

The `BaseRepository` provides comprehensive data access patterns:

1. **Core Operations**:
   - CRUD with async SQLAlchemy
   - Batch operations for efficiency
   - Soft delete support
   - Optimistic locking via versioning

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Specification pattern for complex queries
   - Eager loading configuration
   - Metrics collection
   - Structured error handling

### Specification Pattern Implementation

```python
class Specification(ABC, Generic[T]):
    def is_satisfied_by(self, entity: T) -> bool
    def and_(self, other) -> "AndSpecification[T]"
    def or_(self, other) -> "OrSpecification[T]"
    def not_(self) -> "NotSpecification[T]"
```

- Composable query logic
- Type-safe entity filtering
- SQL translation via SpecificationEvaluator
- Reusable business rules

### Unit of Work and Transaction Management

1. **BaseUnitOfWork**:
   - Manages database session lifecycle
   - Collects and publishes domain events
   - Automatic commit/rollback on context exit
   - Event publishing after successful commit

2. **TransactionManager**:
   - Nested transaction support via savepoints
   - Context manager interface
   - Automatic rollback on exceptions

3. **DistributedTransactionManager**:
   - Two-phase commit protocol implementation
   - Multiple participant support
   - Transaction recovery mechanisms
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Caching Layer Integration

- **CachedRepository** extends BaseRepository
- TTL-based caching with Redis
- Cache invalidation on writes
- Metrics for cache hit/miss rates
- Extensible for related cache invalidation

## Dependency Injection

### Container Configuration

The custom DI container provides:
- Thread-safe singleton management
- Multiple registration types (instance, class, factory)
- Explicit override prevention
- Lazy singleton initialization

### Service Lifetime Management

```python
# Singleton registration
container.register(Database, Database, singleton=True)

# Transient registration (new instance per resolve)
container.register(Service, ServiceImpl)

# Instance registration (pre-built singleton)
container.register(Config, config_instance)
```

### Wiring and Resolution Patterns

- Type-safe resolution with generics
- Thread-safe singleton initialization
- Clear error messages for missing services
- Integration with FastAPI dependency system

### Extension Points for New Modules

- Register module-specific services in bootstrap
- Override services for testing
- Compose services using factory functions
- Integrate with FastAPI's `Depends`

## Security Framework

### Authentication Flow

1. **JWT Token Structure**:
   - Access tokens (short-lived, 15 min default)
   - Refresh tokens (long-lived, 30 days default)
   - Full JWT claims (iss, aud, iat, exp, jti)
   - Configurable algorithms and secrets

2. **Middleware Integration**:
   - Bearer token extraction
   - Token validation and decoding
   - User context injection into request
   - Public endpoint bypass

### Authorization Mechanisms

- Permission-based authorization planned
- Authorization context with user, role, permissions
- Department-based scoping support
- Middleware sets auth context for downstream use

### Security Utilities and Helpers

1. **Password Handling**:
   - Argon2id with configurable parameters
   - Secure random token generation
   - Password validation rules

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Email masking utility
   - Phone number masking utility
   - Secure token generation

### Middleware Integration Points

- Authentication middleware in request pipeline
- Rate limiting middleware support
- CORS configuration
- Security headers can be added

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Classification and Hierarchy

```
EzzDayError (base)
├── DomainError (400)
├── ApplicationError (400)
│   ├── ValidationError (422)
│   ├── NotFoundError (404)
│   ├── ConflictError (409)
│   ├── UnauthorizedError (401)
│   ├── ForbiddenError (403)
│   └── RateLimitError (429)
└── InfrastructureError (500)
    ├── ConfigurationError (500)
    └── ExternalServiceError (502)
```

### Error Propagation and Transformation

- Errors include code, message, and details
- HTTP status codes mapped to error types
- Cause chaining for debugging
- Safe serialization with `to_dict()`

### User Experience Considerations

- User-friendly error messages
- Field-level validation errors
- Resource identification in errors
- Rate limit information included

### Monitoring and Alerting Integration

- Structured logging throughout
- Metrics collection on operations
- Error tracking with context
- Integration points for Sentry/monitoring tools
