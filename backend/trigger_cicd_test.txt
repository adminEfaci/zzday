CI/CD Pipeline Test Trigger
===========================

This file is created to trigger the CI/CD pipeline for testing Agent 3 infrastructure components.

Test triggered at: 2025-07-09T07:47:00Z

Components to be tested:
- Security test suite (50+ tests)
- Database optimization analysis
- Performance monitoring with Locust
- Daily health reporting
- Infrastructure resilience patterns

Expected CI/CD pipeline stages:
1. Code Quality & Security Checks
2. Unit Tests (with PostgreSQL/Redis)
3. Integration Tests (with DB optimization)
4. E2E Tests
5. Build Application
6. Deploy to Staging
7. Performance Tests (with Agent 3 Locust)
8. Security Tests (with Agent 3 suite)
9. Health Monitoring

This test validates the complete integration of Agent 3 infrastructure improvements with Agent 0's CI/CD pipeline.
