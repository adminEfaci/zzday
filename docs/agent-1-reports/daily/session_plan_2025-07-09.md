# Session Plan - Agent 1 - 2025-07-09

## Agent Identity
- **Agent Number**: 1
- **Specialization**: Architecture & Integration
- **Branch**: `agent-1-architecture`
- **Focus**: System architecture, module boundaries, integration patterns

## Objectives for This Session
1. Set up workspace and documentation structure
2. Perform comprehensive module dependency analysis
3. Document all architectural violations
4. Create initial architecture validation scripts
5. Begin fixing critical module boundary violations

## Token Budget
- Estimated input tokens: 150,000
- Estimated output tokens: 30,000
- Buffer for discussion: 20%

## Checkpoints
- [ ] 25% - Workspace setup and initial analysis complete
- [ ] 50% - Module violations documented and validation scripts created
- [ ] 75% - Started fixing critical violations
- [ ] 90% - Save state and prepare handoff

## State Preservation
- Critical decisions documented in: `/docs/agent-1-reports/decisions/`
- Progress tracked in: `/docs/agent-1-reports/daily/`
- Next session should start with: Continue fixing module violations

## Priority Tasks
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix direct imports between modules (Audit â†’ Identity)
2. **HIGH**: Create module contract interfaces
3. **HIGH**: Document architecture patterns for other agents
4. **MEDIUM**: Create automated validation tools

## Success Metrics for Session
- All module boundary violations identified and documented
- At least 2 critical violations fixed
- Architecture validation script created
- Clear documentation for other agents

## Coordination Notes
- Agent 0 has completed CI/CD setup
- Need to ensure architecture tests integrate with CI/CD
- Must coordinate with Agent 3 on repository patterns
- Document patterns for Agent 2's service work
