# Identity Module Architecture Analysis

**Module**: Identity  
**Analysis Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Agent**: Architecture Agent  
**Status**: In Progress

## Executive Summary

The Identity module demonstrates strong adherence to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles with clear layer separation and well-defined boundaries. The module implements comprehensive identity and access management features including authentication, authorization, multi-factor authentication, session management, and security policies.

## Module Overview

### Purpose
The Identity module serves as the core authentication and authorization system, managing:
