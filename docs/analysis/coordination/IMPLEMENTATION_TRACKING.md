## 🔍 Agent Status Summary

### Testing Agent
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- **Critical Issues Resolved**: 3/3 (100%)
- **High Priority Issues Resolved**: 4/4 (100%)
- **Total Issues Resolved**: 7/7 (100%)
- **Commit**: 7890790 on analysis/services branch

### Service Agent
- **Status**: 🔄 ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION
- **Critical Issues**: N/A
- **High Priority Issues**: 0/2 (0%)
- **Current Focus**: Consolidating duplicate services

### Domain Agent
- **Status**: 🔄 ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION
- **Critical Issues**: 0/3 (0%)
- **High Priority Issues**: N/A
- **Current Focus**: Value object type alignment

### Other Agents
- **Status**: 🔄 AWAITING CONFIRMATION
- Need explicit confirmation of CAP understanding and implementation plans

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

1. **Confirm CAP Understanding**: Architecture, Infrastructure, Interface, Documentation agents must explicitly confirm CAP understanding
2. **Submit Implementation Plans**: All agents except Testing must submit detailed implementation plans
3. **Begin Daily Merges**: Start daily merge cycle once all agents confirm readiness
4. **Resolve Conflicts**: Prepare for potential conflicts between Domain and Infrastructure on value objects
