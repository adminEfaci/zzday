## 🎯 Multi-Agent Peer Review Requirements

### **1. Architecture Agent Review** (Required)
**Branch**: `analysis/architecture`  
**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] **Domain Layer Compliance**: Verify domain boundaries are properly maintained
- [ ] **Hexagonal Architecture**: Confirm dependency flow direction is correct

**Review Checklist**:
```markdown
- [ ] User aggregate maintains proper aggregate boundaries
- [ ] No infrastructure dependencies in domain layer
- [ ] Value object usage follows DDD patterns
- [ ] Domain events properly handled (if applicable)
```

### **2. Infrastructure Agent Review** (Required)
**Branch**: `analysis/infrastructure`  
**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] **Type Alignment**: Verify PasswordHash usage is consistent across infrastructure
- [ ] **Contract Compliance**: Ensure infrastructure services properly implement domain contracts
- [ ] **Repository Patterns**: Validate repository implementations align with domain expectations
- [ ] **External Service Integration**: Confirm password hasher service integration

**Review Checklist**:
```markdown
- [ ] PasswordHash type used consistently in all infrastructure components
- [ ] Password hasher service implements correct interface contract
- [ ] No domain logic leaked into infrastructure layer
- [ ] Database mappings handle PasswordHash correctly
```

### **3. Services Agent Review** (Required)
**Branch**: `analysis/services`  
**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] **Application Service Integration**: Verify application services work with updated domain model
- [ ] **Command/Query Handlers**: Ensure handlers properly utilize cleaned User aggregate
- [ ] **Service Orchestration**: Confirm services don't rely on removed domain imports
- [ ] **Use Case Flows**: Validate end-to-end workflows still function

**Review Checklist**:
```markdown
- [ ] User registration/authentication flows work with PasswordHash
- [ ] Application services properly delegate to domain aggregates
- [ ] No service explosion from domain changes
- [ ] Command handlers utilize clean User aggregate methods
```

### **4. Testing Agent Review** (Required)
**Branch**: `analysis/testing`  
**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage**: Verify domain changes have proper test coverage
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Ensure domain/infrastructure integration tests pass
- [ ] **Type Safety Tests**: Confirm PasswordHash type safety is tested
- [ ] **Regression Prevention**: Validate tests prevent future anemic domain model issues

**Review Checklist**:
```markdown
- [ ] Unit tests cover new domain logic in User aggregate
- [ ] Integration tests verify PasswordHash flow end-to-end
- [ ] Tests prevent service imports in domain aggregates
- [ ] Performance impact of domain changes tested
```

### **5. Interface Agent Review** (Required)
**Branch**: `analysis/interfaces`  
**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] **API Contract Alignment**: Verify API still functions with domain changes
- [ ] **DTO Mapping**: Ensure DTOs properly map to/from PasswordHash
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Confirm error scenarios properly handled
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Validate no breaking changes for consumers

**Review Checklist**:
```markdown
- [ ] Authentication APIs work with PasswordHash changes
- [ ] User management endpoints handle cleaned User aggregate
- [ ] Error responses maintain consistency
- [ ] API documentation reflects any changes
```

## 🔄 Peer Review Execution Plan

### **Phase 1: Individual Agent Reviews** (Days 1-2)
Each agent performs independent review:
1. **Checkout Domain Agent Changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout analysis/domain
   git pull origin analysis/domain
   ```

2. **Review Implementation**: 
   - Analyze modified files against their domain expertise
   - Validate changes don't introduce issues in their area
   - Test integration points with their components

3. **Document Findings**:
   ```markdown
   # [Agent] Review of Domain Agent CAP Fixes
   ## CAP-002 Review
   - Status: ✅ Approved / ❌ Issues Found
   - Comments: [detailed feedback]
   
   ## CAP-012 Review  
   - Status: ✅ Approved / ❌ Issues Found
   - Comments: [detailed feedback]
   ```

### **Phase 2: Cross-Agent Integration Review** (Day 3)
**Coordination Agent orchestrates**:
1. **Consolidate Reviews**: Gather all agent feedback
2. **Identify Conflicts**: Resolve any conflicting opinions
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end workflows
4. **Approval Decision**: Make go/no-go decision

### **Phase 3: Implementation Validation** (Day 4)
1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Ensure no regressions
2. **Performance Validation**: Confirm no performance degradation
3. **Security Review**: Validate security implications
4. **Documentation Update**: Update CAP status and living docs

## 📊 Success Criteria

### **Review Approval Requirements**
- [ ] **5/5 Agent Approvals**: All agents must approve both CAP fixes
- [ ] **Zero Critical Issues**: No critical issues found during review
- [ ] **Test Suite Passing**: 100% test suite success rate
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**: No >5% performance degradation

### **CAP Status Updates**
Upon successful peer review:
- CAP-002: Status changes to ✅ **PEER REVIEWED & APPROVED**
- CAP-012: Status changes to ✅ **PEER REVIEWED & APPROVED**
- Overall CAP Progress: 2/12 critical issues → **17% completion**

## 🚨 Escalation Procedures

### **If Issues Found**
1. **Minor Issues**: Domain Agent addresses within 24 hours
2. **Major Issues**: Coordination Agent facilitates cross-agent discussion
3. **Blocking Issues**: Escalate to architectural review board

### **Review Timeline**
- **Days 1-2**: Individual agent reviews
- **Day 3**: Integration review and conflict resolution
- **Day 4**: Final validation and CAP update
- **Total**: 4-day peer review cycle

## 📈 Next Steps After Approval

1. **Update CAP Document**: Mark issues as peer-reviewed and approved
2. **Merge to Coordination**: Integrate approved changes into coordination branch
3. **Update Living Documentation**: Reflect completed work in all documentation
4. **Assign Next Critical Issues**: Continue with remaining 10 critical CAP issues
5. **Weekly Review**: Include in next weekly consolidation report
