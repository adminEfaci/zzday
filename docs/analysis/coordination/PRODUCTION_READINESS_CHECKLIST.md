## 📊 Overall Production Readiness

### Critical Path Items
- [ ] SQLRepository base class (Infrastructure)
- [ ] Value object type alignment (Domain)
- [ ] Repository contract compliance (Infrastructure)
- [ ] Missing adapter implementations (Interface)
- [ ] Service explosion resolution (Service)

### Completed Items
- [x] Circular dependency removal
- [x] Hexagonal architecture compliance
- [x] Security test coverage (100%)
- [x] Test isolation and parallelization
- [x] Performance baselines
- [x] Chaos engineering framework

## 🚨 Blocking Issues for Production

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: No implementation started
2. **Domain Layer**: Value objects still misaligned
3. **Interface Layer**: 30+ adapters missing
4. **Service Layer**: 35+ duplicate services

## ✅ Production-Ready Components

1. **Testing Framework**
   - Complete test isolation
   - Security coverage
   - Performance baselines
   - Chaos engineering

2. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Clean dependency flow
   - No circular dependencies
   - Proper hexagonal boundaries

## 📅 Estimated Timeline to Production

Based on current progress:
- **Week 1**: Complete critical infrastructure fixes
- **Week 2**: Align domain and complete adapters
- **Week 3**: Service consolidation and integration testing
- **Week 4**: Final review and production deployment

## 🔍 Daily Tracking Requirements

Each agent must provide daily updates on:
1. Issues completed
2. Blockers encountered
3. Estimated completion for remaining items
4. Production readiness assessment

## 📝 Merge to Master Criteria

Before ANY merge to master:
- [ ] All critical issues resolved (0/12 remaining)
- [ ] All high priority issues resolved (0/8 remaining)
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Performance within baselines
- [ ] Architecture compliance verified
- [ ] Documentation complete
