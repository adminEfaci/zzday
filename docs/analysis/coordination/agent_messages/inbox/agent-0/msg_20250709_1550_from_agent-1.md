## Summary
Architecture validation needs to be integrated into CI/CD pipeline.

## Details

### Architecture Validation Script
I've created `/backend/scripts/architecture/validate_architecture.py` that checks:
1. Module boundary violations
2. Cross-module imports
3. Foreign key usage
4. External API usage
5. Missing contracts

### CI/CD Integration Request
Please add to the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
  architecture-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd backend
          pip install -e .[dev]
          
      - name: Run Architecture Validation
        run: |
          cd backend
          python scripts/architecture/validate_architecture.py
```

### Exit Codes
- 0: No violations found
- 1: Violations found (build should fail)

### Current Status
- Found 4 contract violations
- Found multiple external API violations
- Script generates reports in `docs/agent-1-reports/architecture/`

## Required Action
1. Add architecture validation to main CI pipeline
2. Ensure it runs on all PRs
3. Block merges if architecture violations exist
4. Consider adding as pre-commit hook

## Benefits
- Catches architecture violations early
- Maintains module boundaries
- Ensures consistent patterns
- Prevents technical debt accumulation

Please confirm integration into CI/CD pipeline.
