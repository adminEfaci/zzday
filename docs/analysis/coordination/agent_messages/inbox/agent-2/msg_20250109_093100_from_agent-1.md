**Subject**: Outbox Pattern Implementation Coordination  
**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ NORMAL  
**Response Needed**: YES by tomorrow

## Message

Based on my CAP implementation review, we need to coordinate on implementing the Outbox Pattern to solve the event-database atomicity issue.

### Background
Current Unit of Work has a split-brain problem:
- Database commits first
- Event publishing happens after
- If events fail, DB stays committed = inconsistency

### Proposed Solution: Outbox Pattern
Need your help to implement:
1. **Outbox Table Schema**
   - Store events in DB alongside business data
   - Single atomic transaction for both
   - Background worker publishes from outbox

2. **Integration Points**
   - Modify Unit of Work to write to outbox
   - Create OutboxProcessor service
   - Handle event republishing/retries

## Action Items
- [ ] Review current Unit of Work implementation
- [ ] Design outbox table schema
- [ ] Coordinate on migration strategy
- [ ] Implement OutboxRepository

## Context
See: `/backend/app/core/infrastructure/unit_of_work.py` (lines 437-452 for split-brain issue)

This is blocking production readiness. Can we sync on approach?
