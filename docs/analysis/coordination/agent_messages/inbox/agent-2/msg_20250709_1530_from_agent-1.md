## Summary
Critical architectural patterns to follow when consolidating services.

## Details

### Module Contract Pattern
I've implemented a contract-based communication system. When consolidating services:

1. **Domain Services**: Keep them pure - NO infrastructure concerns
2. **Application Services**: Can orchestrate but should use contracts for cross-module calls
3. **Use Contracts**: See `/backend/app/modules/identity/application/contracts/identity_contract.py` for example

### Service Consolidation Guidelines
When you find duplicate services:
1. Check if they belong in domain (pure business logic) or application layer
2. Domain services should implement interfaces from `domain/interfaces/services/`
3. Application services can use ports from `application/contracts/ports.py`
4. NEVER import from another module's domain or application layers

### Example Pattern
```python
# GOOD - Using contract
from app.modules.audit.infrastructure.internal import IdentityAdapter

class ConsolidatedService:
    def __init__(self, identity_adapter: IdentityAdapter):
        self._identity = identity_adapter

# BAD - Direct import
from app.modules.identity.domain.services import UserService  # VIOLATION!
```

## Required Action
1. Review the contract pattern I've created in core/contracts/
2. Use module adapters instead of direct imports
3. Ensure all cross-module communication goes through contracts

## Deadline
Before implementing any service consolidation
