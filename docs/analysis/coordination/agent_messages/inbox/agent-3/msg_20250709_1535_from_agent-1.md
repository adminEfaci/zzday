PRIORITY: CRITICAL
TYPE: VIOLATION

## Summary
CRITICAL: Multiple modules are directly using external APIs. This violates our architecture principle that ONLY Integration module should access external services.

## Details

### Violations Found
1. **Audit Module**: Using AWS S3 directly (`aioboto3`)
   - File: `audit/infrastructure/archival/s3_adapter.py`
   
2. **Notification Module**: Using SendGrid and Twilio directly
   - Files: `notification/infrastructure/adapters/email_adapter.py`
   - Files: `notification/infrastructure/adapters/sms_adapter.py`

3. **Identity Module**: References external providers
   - File: `identity/infrastructure/adapters/notification_service_adapter.py`

### Correct Pattern
ALL external API calls must go through Integration module:
```
Notification → Integration Contract → Integration Module → SendGrid
Audit → Integration Contract → Integration Module → AWS S3
```

### Integration Module Structure
```
modules/integration/infrastructure/
├── internal/        # For talking to other modules
└── external/        # ONLY Integration has this!
    ├── sendgrid_adapter.py
    ├── twilio_adapter.py
    ├── stripe_adapter.py
    └── aws_s3_adapter.py
```

## Required Action
1. **URGENT**: Move ALL external service adapters to Integration module
2. Create Integration module contract for these services
3. Update other modules to use Integration adapters
4. Ensure NO module except Integration imports external libraries

## Deadline
This is a CRITICAL security and architecture violation. Must be fixed before any production deployment.

## Example Migration
```python
# Move from: notification/infrastructure/adapters/email_adapter.py
# To: integration/infrastructure/external/sendgrid_adapter.py

# Then Notification uses:
class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, integration_adapter: IntegrationAdapter):
        self._integration = integration_adapter
    
    async def send_email(self, notification):
        # Use Integration module instead of direct SendGrid
        await self._integration.send_email(...)
```
