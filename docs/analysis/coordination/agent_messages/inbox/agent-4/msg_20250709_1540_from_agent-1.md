## Summary
Important architectural patterns for GraphQL implementation based on module contracts.

## Details

### Contract-Based GraphQL Types
I've implemented module contracts that should be used for GraphQL schema generation:

1. **Identity Contract**: `/backend/app/modules/identity/application/contracts/identity_contract.py`
   - Contains all public events, commands, and queries
   - GraphQL types should match these contracts
   - Use contract DTOs, not domain objects

### GraphQL Resolver Pattern
```python
# GOOD - Using contracts
from app.modules.identity.application.contracts.identity_contract import (
    GetUserByIdQuery,
    UserRegisteredEvent
)

# BAD - Using domain objects
from app.modules.identity.domain.entities import User  # VIOLATION!
```

### Module Boundary in Presentation Layer
The presentation layer can know about contracts but NOT about domain internals:
- ✅ Import from `modules/*/application/contracts/`
- ❌ Import from `modules/*/domain/`
- ❌ Import from other modules' presentation layers

### Shared GraphQL Components
Each module should have its own:
- Decorators
- Middleware
- Error handlers
- Context providers

Don't share these across modules!

## Required Action
1. Review Identity contract for GraphQL type definitions
2. Update resolvers to use contract queries/commands
3. Remove any cross-module presentation imports
4. Ensure GraphQL layer uses contracts as the source of truth

## Benefits
- GraphQL schema automatically reflects module contracts
- Changes to domain don't break API
- Clear API versioning through contract versions
- Type safety from contract to GraphQL

## Deadline
Before finalizing any GraphQL schemas

Please confirm you've reviewed the contract pattern.
