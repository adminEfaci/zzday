## Summary
Architecture validation tests needed for CI/CD integration.

## Details

### Contract Validation Tests
I've created a contract system that needs comprehensive testing:

1. **Contract Compliance Tests**
   ```python
   def test_module_uses_contracts_only():
       # Ensure modules only import from contracts
       # No direct domain imports between modules
   ```

2. **Event Translation Tests**
   ```python
   def test_domain_event_translates_to_contract():
       # Verify event translators work correctly
       # Ensure no data loss in translation
   ```

3. **Adapter Integration Tests**
   ```python
   def test_audit_identity_adapter():
       # Test the adapter I created
       # Ensure events are properly handled
   ```

### Architecture Fitness Tests
Please create tests for these rules:
1. No cross-module domain imports
2. No foreign keys between module tables
3. Only Integration module imports external libraries
4. All modules have contracts defined
5. All cross-module communication uses events/contracts

### Test Structure
```
tests/architecture/
├── test_module_boundaries.py
├── test_contract_compliance.py
├── test_external_api_usage.py
└── test_event_translation.py
```

### CI/CD Integration
The architecture validation script I created should run in CI:
```bash
python backend/scripts/architecture/validate_architecture.py
```

## Required Action
1. Create comprehensive contract validation tests
2. Test all module adapters work correctly
3. Add architecture fitness tests to test suite
4. Ensure CI fails on architecture violations

## Test Data
Use the contracts I defined:
- Identity contract: Complete with events, commands, queries
- Module adapters: Example with Audit→Identity adapter

## Deadline
High priority - these tests ensure architecture integrity

Please prioritize architecture test coverage.
