# Event-Database Consistency Patterns

**Topic**: Solving Split-Brain in Distributed Systems

## Problem Statement

The fundamental challenge in distributed systems: ensuring atomicity between database operations and event publishing.

### Current Issue
```python
# The split-brain scenario
async def commit(self):
    await self.database.commit()  # Step 1: Database commits
    await self.events.publish()   # Step 2: Events published
    # If Step 2 fails, Step 1 is already committed!
```

## Solution Patterns

### 1. Outbox Pattern (Recommended)
Store events in the database as part of the business transaction.

**Implementation**:
```python
async def commit(self):
    # Single atomic transaction
    async with self.database.transaction():
        # Business data changes
        await self.repository.save(entity)
        
        # Events stored in outbox table
        await self.outbox_repository.store_events(entity.events)
    
    # Background process publishes from outbox
    # If it fails, can retry safely
```

**Pros**:
- True atomicity
- Simple to understand
- Battle-tested pattern

**Cons**:
- Requires background worker
- Eventual consistency for events

### 2. Saga Pattern
Orchestrate distributed transactions with compensations.

**Implementation**:
```python
class OrderSaga:
    async def execute(self):
        try:
            await self.create_order()
            await self.reserve_inventory()
            await self.charge_payment()
            await self.publish_success_event()
        except Exception as e:
            await self.compensate()
```

**Pros**:
- Handles complex workflows
- Business-focused

**Cons**:
- Complex to implement correctly
- Compensation logic can fail

### 3. Event Sourcing
Store events as the source of truth.

**Pros**:
- No split-brain possible
- Complete audit trail

**Cons**:
- Major architectural change
- Complex querying

## Recommendation

For EzzDay's current architecture, **Outbox Pattern** is the best choice:

1. Minimal changes to existing code
2. Solves the split-brain definitively  
3. Well-understood pattern
4. Good tool support

## Implementation Steps

1. Create outbox table schema
2. Modify Unit of Work to write to outbox
3. Implement OutboxProcessor service
4. Add monitoring and alerts
5. Handle edge cases (duplicates, ordering)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Two-Phase Commit** - Doesn't work well in distributed systems
❌ **Synchronous Event Publishing** - Creates tight coupling
❌ **Complex Compensation** - Often more buggy than the problem it solves
