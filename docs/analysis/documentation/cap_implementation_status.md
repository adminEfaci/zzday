## Critical Issues Status

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED

- **Resolution Date**: 2025-07-08
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Updated `password_hasher_service.py` to use PasswordHash instead of HashedPassword
  - Aligned method signatures to include user_context parameter
  - Fixed algorithm mapping from string to HashAlgorithm enum
  - Ensured type consistency across domain/infrastructure boundary
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/backend/app/modules/identity/infrastructure/external/password_hasher_service.py`
- **Verification**: Type alignment confirmed, no compilation errors

#### Issue #12: Anemic Domain Model
- **Module**: Identity
- **Component**: User Aggregate
- **Original Problem**: Service imports in domain aggregates violating DDD principles
- **Agent**: Domain Agent
- **Resolution Date**: 2025-07-08
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Removed service imports from User aggregate
  - Implemented domain logic directly within aggregate
  - Maintained domain purity and proper dependency flow
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/backend/app/modules/identity/domain/aggregates/user.py`
- **Verification**: Domain layer no longer depends on infrastructure services

## Implementation Milestones

### ‚úÖ Week 1 Milestones (Completed)
- [x] Domain Agent analysis and implementation
- [x] Critical issues #2 and #12 resolution
- [x] Documentation updates and tracking

### üîÑ Week 2 Milestones (In Progress)
- [ ] Initialize remaining agent branches
- [ ] Architecture Agent analysis
- [ ] Services Agent analysis
- [ ] Address circular dependencies (#1)
- [ ] Resolve command/query separation (#4)

### ‚è≥ Week 3-4 Milestones (Planned)
- [ ] Infrastructure Agent analysis
- [ ] Interfaces Agent analysis
- [ ] Testing Agent analysis
- [ ] Complete all critical issue resolutions
- [ ] Generate final CAP completion report

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: üü° MEDIUM
- **Resolved**: 2/12 critical issues (17%)
- **Remaining**: 10 critical issues pending
- **Impact**: Domain integrity improved, but architectural and service layer issues remain

### Risk Factors
1. **High**: 10 critical issues still unresolved
2. **Medium**: Multiple agents not yet initialized
3. **Low**: Domain layer now stable and compliant

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Initialize Architecture Agent** - Address circular dependencies and event handling
2. **Initialize Services Agent** - Resolve command/query separation and service coupling
3. **Continue multi-agent workflow** - Maintain momentum from Domain Agent success

### Short-term (2-3 Weeks)
1. **Complete Infrastructure Agent analysis** - Address infrastructure leakage
2. **Complete Interfaces Agent analysis** - Resolve API contract inconsistencies
3. **Complete Testing Agent analysis** - Address test coverage gaps

### Long-term (1 Month)
1. **Full CAP resolution** - All 12 critical issues addressed
2. **Integration verification** - Ensure all fixes work together
3. **Architecture documentation** - Update system documentation with improvements

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns
- **Multi-agent approach effective** - Domain Agent successfully resolved assigned issues
- **Clear issue assignment** - Specific agent responsibility led to focused resolution
- **Git workflow functional** - Branch-based agent work maintained isolation and traceability

### Areas for Improvement
- **Agent initialization pace** - Need to accelerate remaining agent startup
- **Cross-agent coordination** - Some issues may require multi-agent collaboration
- **Documentation updates** - Keep documentation current with implementation progress

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Impact
- **Type Safety**: Improved with PasswordHash alignment
- **Domain Purity**: Enhanced with anemic model cleanup
- **Architecture Compliance**: 17% improvement in critical issue resolution

### Process Metrics
- **Issue Resolution Rate**: 2 issues/week (Domain Agent)
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of resolved issues documented
- **Traceability**: Complete audit trail maintained
