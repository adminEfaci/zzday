# Implementation Phase Tracking

## Documentation Agent Confirmation

**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Agent**: Documentation Agent  
**Branch**: `implementation/documentation`  
**Status**: READY TO TRACK IMPLEMENTATION

### CAP Understanding Confirmed

I have read and understood the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) containing:
- **Total Violations**: 27 across 7 domains
- **Critical Issues**: 12 requiring immediate action
- **My Assignment**: 0 issues (Documentation Agent tracks progress)

### Critical Issues Assignment Matrix

| Issue # | Description | Assigned Agent | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | SQLRepository base class missing | Infrastructure | Not Started |
| 2 | Value object type mismatch (PasswordHash) | Domain | Not Started |
| 3 | Anemic Domain Model | Domain | Not Started |
| 4 | Circular dependencies | Architecture | Not Started |
| 5 | Security test coverage 0% | Testing | Not Started |
| 6 | Test isolation failures | Testing | Not Started |
| 7 | Missing 30+ adapters | Interface | Not Started |
| 8 | Repository contract violations | Infrastructure | Not Started |
| 9 | Fake integration tests | Testing | Not Started |
| 10 | God aggregate (534 lines) | Domain | Not Started |
| 11 | Hexagonal Architecture violations | Architecture | Not Started |
| 12 | Dependency Inversion violations | Infrastructure | Not Started |

### Implementation Progress

**Current Status**: 0/12 Critical Issues Resolved (0%)

### Agent Branch Status

### Tracking Methodology

1. **Daily Updates**: Track git commits from each agent's implementation branch
2. **Issue Resolution**: Monitor actual code changes that resolve CAP issues
3. **Verification**: Confirm fixes through git history and file modifications
4. **Progress Reporting**: Update this document with verifiable implementation progress

### Next Actions

1. Monitor implementation branches for actual code changes
2. Track commit messages referencing CAP issue numbers
3. Verify file modifications align with issue resolutions
4. Update progress metrics based on completed work
